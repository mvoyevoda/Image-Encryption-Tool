# Image-Enrcryption-Tool
Image encryption tool that I developed as part of my undergraduate research project for the City University of New York to demonstrate how bit-plane decomposition and pixel scrambling can be used to effetively encrypt/decrypt images.

This program can be run with the python interpreter:
From the command line run the command **python3 encryption.py**
